**Direct Link (2.0) connection support for transit gateways** (Beta) - Direct Link now supports Transit Gateway connections. A Direct Link connection allows an on-premises network to connect to other networks (for instance, VPC and classic infrastructure) that are connected to the same transit gateway.

   This is a Beta feature that requires special approval. The use of this functionality should not be for production workloads. If you are interested in participating in this Beta, you can either open a Sev 4 support case and request access or contact your IBM Sales representative.
