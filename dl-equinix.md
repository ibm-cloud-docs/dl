1. Select a **Connection Speed**, then click **Next**.   
1. Review and click **Submit Your Order**.

The IBM Special Network Services (SNS) team receives your request and is able approve the connection in the buyer-side portal. You can view your newly created virtual connection for Direct Link by going to **Connections**. The connection will be in a pending, provisioning state (**Pending Provider VLAN**).

Accept the connection request by navigating to the IBM Cloud Direct Link page and clicking **Accept** from the Actions menu. The virtual connection shows as **Provisioned** in the Equinix Fabric portal.

The timeline for approval is within 24 hours. If the 24-hour Service Level Agreement (SLA) is not acceptable, you can [create an IBM Support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/form) and request that it be routed to the SNS team.

Optionally, you can enable BGP MD5 authentication to provide additional security for the BGP session. For more information, see [Accepting provider-created connections](/docs/dl?topic=dl-accepting-the-provider-created-connection).
