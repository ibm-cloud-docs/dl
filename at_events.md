## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events are available in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region.

To view these events, you must [provision an instance](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision#provision) of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region. Then, you must [open the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch).

## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_iam_analyze}

Refer to the following information when analyzing events:

- Use the search bar to search for `action:directlink.connect.virtual-connection` to get the list of events related to Direct Link Connect, or `action:directlink.dedicated.virtual-connection`  to get events that are related to Direct Link Dedicated.
- The target field identifies the Direct Link gateway assocated with an event. When the gateway exists in a different account or there is no gateway associated with the request, the target is set as `crn:v1:bluemix:public:directlink:global:a/<your account ID>:::`.  Events that don't correspond to a gateway will not have resource group information. For more information about cross-account gateway connections, see [Cross-account (VPC only) network connectivity with Direct Link](/docs/dl?topic=dl-add-virtual-connection#cross-account-virtual-connection).
- Events that report update actions do not include information about the delta of the change.
- The event's initiator field contains information about who initiated each request. In authorized cross-account scenarios `IBM` is identified as the initiator.
- The name of the service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is `directlink.connect`; therefore, all AT events have an action formatted as `<svcname>.<object>.<action>`, where `svcname` can be `directlink.connect` or `directlink.dedicated`.
