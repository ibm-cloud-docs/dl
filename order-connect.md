# Ordering {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} Connect
{: #how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect}
{: help}
{: support}

To order {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect, you must determine the location connecting to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, complete the required configuration information, then click **Create** to submit your order.
{:shortdesc}

If you participated in the Direct Link Connect beta program, you must migrate your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect gateways to a standard, paid plan. For more information, see [Migrating {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateways](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect#migration).
{: note}

## Planning considerations
{: #before-you-begin-connect}

* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} highly recommends that a second, diverse direct link be established to prevent outages, whether unplanned, or planned due to maintenance. For more information, see [Models for diversity and redundancy](/docs/dl?topic=dl-models-for-diversity-and-redundancy-in-direct-link).
* All subnets of the VPC or classic network will be connected to the direct link. When creating VPCs, make sure to create the VPCs with non-overlapping prefixes and unique subnets. To ensure successful connectivity with the classic infrastructure, do not use IP addresses for your VPCs in the `10.0.0.0/14`, `10.200.0.0/14`, `10.198.0.0/15`, and `10.254.0.0/16` blocks.
* A Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)/IPsec tunneling requirement between a customer edge router (CER) and a customer virtual router in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} requires a non-conflicting subnet when ordering. Default addresses for Direct Link 2.0 are non-routable and do not support tunneling.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC permits the use of RFC-1918 and IANA-registered IPv4 address space, privately within your VPC, with some exceptions in the IANA Special-Purpose ranges, and select ranges assigned to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.  When using IANA-registered ranges within your enterprise, and within VPCs in conjunction with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link, custom routes must be installed in each zone. For more information, see [Routing considerations for IANA-registered IP assignments](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-interconnectivity#routing-considerations-iana).

## Ordering instructions
{: #instructions-connect}

To order Direct Link Connect, you must determine the location that connects to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, complete the required configuration information, then click **Create** to submit your order for processing.
{:shortdesc}

To order Direct Link Connect, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://{DomainName}/){:external} account.
1. Click Menu ![Menu icon](images/menu_icon.png) on the upper left of the page, then click **Interconnectivity**.
1. Scroll to locate the Connect tile, then click **Order {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}**.

   ![Ordering options](/images/dl_options.png)   

   Alternatively, you can click **Direct Link** on the left navigation pane to view the Direct Link page, which lists existing Direct Link instances. From this page, you can click **Order Direct Link** > **Direct Link Connect**.
   {: tip}
1. In the Before you begin section, click **Open checklist** to review the ordering process (also described in [Completing the connection](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect#complete-connection-connect)).
1. In the Resource section, complete the following information:
   * Type a name for your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection.
   * Choose a resource group to create the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection. Resource groups help manage and contain resources associated with an account. Select **default** if you don't have any other groups defined in the drop-down list. For more information about resource groups, see [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup).

      ![Before you begin and Resource sections](/images/dl-config-connect.png)   

1. In the Gateway section, select a geography, followed by a market, type, site, and routing option. Then, select a provider and a connection speed.

   Available speeds are based on your provider's location. {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect supports the following speeds: 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 25 Gbps, 40 Gbps, 50 Gbps, and 100 Gbps.
   {:note}  

   ![Gateway section](/images/dl-location-connect.png)  

   Local and global routing options are supported for {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect. The routing option that you select determines the reachability of the resources in the selected location. If you select the **Global** routing option along with your location selections, the **Region** menu list shows all the regions that are globally available in the specific account. After selecting a region, you can select any VPC from the **Available connections** menu. If you select **Local** routing, then only the region that corresponds to the selected location is available. When selected, VPCs available in the local region for your account are shown.  

1. In the Billing section, select **Metered** or **Unmetered**. Metered pricing is paying only for what you use; unmetered is unlimited access, for a predicable, monthly fee. Keep in mind that pricing is determined by the routing option and speed that you choose. See [Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}}](/docs/dl?topic=dl-pricing-for-ibm-cloud-dl) for details.

   ![Billing section](/images/dl-billing.png)  

   Unmetered billing is only available for specific speeds.
   {: important}

1. {: #dl-connect-bgp}In the BGP section, complete the following information:

   * Depending on the speed that you selected, you might need to select a port for the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway. The speed range attainable with available ports is shown.

   * Select a BGP peering subnet for the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connection. There are two choices for BGP subnets:
      * Select **Auto-select IP** for IBM to assign an IP address from IP range, `169.254.0.0/16`.
      * Select **Manual-select IP** to specify two of your own IP addresses (in CIDR format) from the ranges `10.254.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `169.254.0.0/16`, or `Public` (a public IP address that you own). Manual-select is useful when trying to avoid conflicts with an existing subnet in use.

      **Important**: Make sure that any self-provided BGP addresses do not conflict with blocks that are used by IBM, or by resources external to your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} deployment. Also, if you plan to use GRE or IPsec tunneling with your Direct Link gateway, you must select a BGP IP other than `169.254.0.0/16`.

   * Enter your BGP ASN.

      * Make sure that any self-provided BGP addresses do not conflict with blocks that are used by IBM, or by resources external to your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} deployment.
      * **For Layer-3 providers only**: You must specify the carrier's ASN, not your own. For a list of carrier interconnection types, see [Comparing Layer-2 and Layer-3 connections for {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}](/docs/dl?topic=dl-comparing-layer-2-layer-3).
      * Excluded ASNs: `0`, `13884`, `36351`, `64512`, `64513`, `65100`, `65201-65234`, `65402-65433`, `65500`, and `420106500-4201065999`.

   ![BGP section](/images/dl-bgp-connect.png)  

1. In the Connections section, select the type of network connection that you want to bind to the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway. You can select a connection type when you create a direct link, or after your direct link is provisioned.

   Select from the following connection types:

      * **Classic infrastructure** networks allow you to connect to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic resources. Only one classic infrastructure connection is allowed per {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway.
      * **VPC** networks can contain either first or second generation compute resources, allowing you to connect to your accountâ€™s VPC resources.

   ![Connections section](/images/dl-conn-connect.png) 

      You cannot request a connection to a network in another account when you create a gateway. However, you can request a connection to a network in another account after a gateway is provisioned. You also can create classic infrastructure and VPC connections after a gateway is created. To learn more, see [Adding virtual connections to a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway](/docs/dl?topic=dl-add-virtual-connection).
      {:tip}

1. An order summary shows pricing estimates for your review. Read and agree to the [{{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} prerequisites](/docs/dl?topic=dl-ibm-cloud-dl-prerequisites) and review Cloud Services [Terms](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/searchsaas/?searchview&searchorder=4&searchmax=0&query=(Direct+Link+Connect)). Then, click **Create** to complete your order.  

   If you want to add GB egress data to your estimate, click **Add to estimate** to calculate the cost. You can also click the **About** tab for links to {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} pricing tables and other helpful resources.
   {:tip}

After you create your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} order, the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} dashboard indicates **Create in progress** order status. If you refresh the page after a few minutes, it shows **Provisioned** status.

## Completing the connection
{: #complete-connection-connect}

To complete your connection, follow these steps:

1. Contact your network provider and negotiate connectivity to your on-premises or colocation.
1. Create a request on the provider portal to order a virtual circuit. Reference the case ID of the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect request as your Request ID or Authorization ID.      
1. Configure the BGP parameters on the Customer Edge Router (CER) for BGP session establishment. After this completes, the BGP status indicates `Established`.

## Migrating Direct Link Connect gateways
{: #migration}

If you participated in the beta release, you must migrate to a standard, paid plan to continue using instances that you created during the beta. Any instances that continue to use the beta plan for this service are subject to deletion.  
{: preview}

To migrate Direct Link Connect gateways to a standard, paid plan, follow these steps:

1. Install {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI on your system, if you have not already done so. For more information, see [Getting started with the IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).
1. Log in to the account that you used to create the Direct Link 2.0 Connect gateways.
1. Enter the following command:

   ```
   ibmcloud resource service-instance-update NAME --service-plan-id SERVICE_PLAN_ID
   ```
   {: pre}

   Where:

   * `NAME` is the name of the gateway instance.
   * `service-plan-id` indicates the type of plan.
   * `SERVICE_PLAN_ID` is the ID of the service plan that you want to set. For Direct Link Connect, this ID is `3341e514-f13c-469b-800c-03c7e827fc7b`.

   For example:

   ```
   ibmcloud resource service-instance-update nwk-stdplan --service-plan-id 3341e514-f13c-469b-800c-03c7e827fc7b
   ```
   Where `nwk-stdplan` is the name of the gateway that you created in the account.
