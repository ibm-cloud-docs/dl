# Leveraging ECMP for redundant connections
{: #leverage-ecmp-redundant-connections}

Equal-cost multipath (ECMP) is a feature of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). ECMP alone is not sufficient to achieve redundancy, and the use cases in this topic explain why.
{: shortdesc}

## Use Case 1: ECMP without diversity
{: #usecase-one}

ECMP isnâ€™t designed for creating redundant connections but for balancing the load over two links. With ECMP on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, both connections must terminate to the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} cross-connect router (XCR), which makes it a single point of failure. In other words, ECMP can be provisioned as two sessions only on the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} XCR.

ECMP for redundancy or load balancing can impact diversity at the IBM XCR. As a result, careful design is recommended for projects with Diversity or High Availability (HA) requirements.

## Use Case 2: ECMP with diversity
{: #usecase-two}

ECMP is a feature of BGP. If you want to use ECMP and have redundancy, you must have two {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} connections on each XCR so that you can have two ECMP sessions going simultaneously.

For HA with ECMP, it is recommended that four {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} circuits be established, with two of them at diverse XCRs to achieve diversity.
