# Upgrading the bandwidth of your Direct Link Dedicated connection
{: #dl-connection}

Typically, IBM installs speeds of 1 GB and lower on 1 GB optics. For speeds of 2-10 GB, IBM installs 10 GB optics. As a result, an upgrade of greater than 1 GB would require new optics to be assigned or inserted. It would be a service affecting event. If you anticipate that type of growth, it's possible to request 10 GB optical fibers to be installed at the beginning of your Direct Link deployment, or to order 2 GB initially so that the 10 GB optics are in place.
