Typically, IBM installs speeds of 1 GB and lower on 1 GB optics. For speeds of 2-10 GB, IBM installs 10 GB optics.

If you anticipate that type of growth, it's possible to request 10 GB optical fibers to be installed at the beginning of your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} deployment, or to order 2 GB initially so that the 10 GB optics are in place.
