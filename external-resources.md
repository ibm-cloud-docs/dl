## Papers and case studies

* [**Hybrid Cloud white paper**](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/cloud/bluemix/network/direct-link/ibm-hybrid-cloud-whitepaper.pdf){: external}

    **Abstract:** Krystallize Technologies set up three different “real world” configurations that use the architecture that is described in this paper to design a dedicated, low-latency, private connection between cloud services and customer-provided network equipment, storage, and compute infrastructure that is durable and affordable.

    This paper presents test results that show how a well-designed, well-executed, hybrid cloud architecture performs versus one that uses standard facilities, using connections and an architecture that is not optimized for application performance.

     * Direct Link Dedicated Hosting solution features and benefits
     * Reference solution for implementing NetApp private storage for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, colocated in a Digital Reality data center
     * Results of performance tests conducted by Krystallize Technologies


* [**Case Study for Direct Link and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**](https://www.digitalrealty.com/case-studies/ibm-cloud){: external}

    **Abstract:** As {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} needed to expand its global data center footprint to meet burgeoning demand for its Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering, it needed the right data center partner to achieve the best available combination of power, space, and price.

    Delivery systems that put extra steps between server deployments, cloud, and customers were too slow and indirect to deliver the low latency and high throughput {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} promises its customers.

    Choosing to colocate at Digital Realty’s hub locations in APAC and the US puts {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers right next door to Digital Realty’s world-class data center deployments, with direct dark fiber connection between them.
