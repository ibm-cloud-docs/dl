# Getting help and support for Direct Link
{: #help-and-support}

If you experience an issue or have questions when using Direct Link, you can use the following resources before you open a support case.
{: shortdesc}

* Review the [FAQs](/docs/dl?topic=dl-faqs) in the product documentation.
* Review the [troubleshooting documentation](/docs/dl?topic=dl-troubleshoot-connection-down-after-scheduled-maintenance) to troubleshoot and resolve common issues.
* Check the status of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and resources by going to the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external}.
* Review [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: external} to see whether other users experienced the same problem. When you ask a question, tag the question with `ibm-cloud` and `direct-link`, so that it's seen by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development teams.

If you still can't resolve the problem, you can open a support case. For more information, see [Creating support cases](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-open-case). And, if you're looking to provide feedback, see [Submitting feedback](/docs/overview?topic=overview-feedback).
