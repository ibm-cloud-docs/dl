You can update a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway either before or after the gateway moves to the **Provisioned** state. However, a gateway is restricted from editing during **In review** and some **in progress** states.

To edit a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway, follow these steps:

1. Click **Actions** on the gateway's details page and then click **Edit**. A page with the gateway's details shows.
2. Update the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} name, link speed, and routing option as needed.

   If you modify the speed or routing option, the pricing changes.
3. Read and agree to the [{{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} prerequisites](/docs/dl?topic=dl-ibm-cloud-dl-prerequisites).
4. Click **Submit** for your changes to take effect.

There is no disruption to the existing {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway. Updated charges take effect during the next billing cycle.
