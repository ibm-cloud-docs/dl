# Getting started with IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated
{: #get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl}

Use IBM Cloud Direct Link to seamlessly connect your on-premises resources to your cloud resources. The speed and reliability of Direct Link lets you extend your organizationâ€™s data center network and offers more consistent, higher-throughput connectivity&mdash;without touching the public internet.

IBM introduces a new release of Direct Link Dedicated now suporting VPC resources&mdash;the first of our "next generation" Direct Link offerings. Currently, this "limited availability" release only services the North America geography (Washington, D.C. and Dallas markets) with more locations being rolled out in 2020.

Highlights include:

* Metered billing, which lowers the barrier of entry to IBM Cloud.
* Support for connections to multiple IBM Cloud accounts from a single direct link.
* Support for multiple VPCs (without classic access) from a single Direct Link within the same account.
* Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) address to create native connectivity between your on-premises environment and IBM Cloud.


Capabilities coming soon:

* Support for Virtual Private Endpoints (VPEs) from customer on-premises from a single customer account.
* Support for a Direct Link connection to venues, such as Blockchain, SAP on Power, and more.
* Support for a Direct Link connection to Public services; for example, IBM Cloud Object Storage (ICOS).

To get started using IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated, follow these [step-by-step instructions](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-dedicated).
