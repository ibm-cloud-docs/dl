* IBM Cloud highly recommends that you establish a second, diverse direct link to prevent outages, whether unplanned, or planned due to maintenance. For more information, see [Models for diversity and redundancy in Direct Link](/docs/dl?topic=dl-models-for-diversity-and-redundancy-in-direct-link).

* If you require a diverse, redundant, or multi-cloud deployment for Direct Link Connect, see [Alternatives for your Direct Link Connect deployment](/docs/dl?topic=dl-alternatives-for-your-ibm-cloud-direct-link-deployment).

* For more information about {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} offerings, see the [FAQs](/docs/dl?topic=dl-faqs).

Currently, a migration path does not exist from {{site.data.keyword.dlc_short}} offerings to {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}. You must order a new {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Dedicated or {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect connection.
