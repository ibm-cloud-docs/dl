# Getting started with IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated
{: #get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl}

Use IBM Cloud Direct Link to connect your on-premises resources to your cloud resources seamlessly. The speed and reliability of Direct Link lets you extend your organization’s data center network and offers more consistent, higher-throughput connectivity&mdash;without touching the public internet.

IBM introduces a new Direct Link Dedicated release for VPC&mdash;the first of our "next generation" Direct Link offerings. Currently, this "limited availability" release only services the North America geography (Washington, D.C. and Dallas markets) with more locations being rolled out in 2020.

Highlights include:

* Metered billing, which lowers the barrier of entry to IBM Cloud.
* Support for connections to multiple IBM Cloud accounts from a single direct link.
* Support for multiple VPCs (without classic access) from a single Direct Link within the same account.
* Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) address to create native connectivity between your on-premises environment and IBM Cloud.


Capabilities coming soon:

* Support for Virtual Private Endpoints (VPEs) from customer on-premises from a single customer account.
* Support for a Direct Link connection to venues (CMS, Blockchain, SAP on Power, and more).
* Support for a Direct Link connection to Public (for example, ICOS).

To get started using IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated, follow these [step-by-step instructions](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-dedicated). If you want help with getting started, open a case through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/add){: external}, or you can contact your IBM Cloud Sales representative.
